          <h2 class="item-title">LEARNING BY DOING</h2>
          <h3 class="item-subtitle">The Holberton School Way</h3>
          <p>
            Project-based learning is a proven alternative learning methodology
            to the traditional teacher-led lecture and educational memorization
            method.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than teaching a lot of theory and having you occasionally
            apply a fraction of your knowledge on a class project, we do the
            opposite. We give you increasingly difficult programming challenges
            to solve with minimal initial directions on how to solve them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through learning by doing and learning how to rapidly adopt new
            skills and methodologies, you are better prepared to succeed in this
            ever evolving industry.You are trained, challenged, and tested on
            today's technologies, but the learning skills you develop here will
            prepare you to adapt to and learn the technologies and the coding
            languages of tomorrow.

          <h3 class="item-subtitle">We succeed when you succeed</h3>
          <p>
            We don’t think that financial capacity should be a barrier. That's
            why you will be given flexible options to finance your tuition.
          </p>
          <p>When Holberton School students succeed, everyone succeeds.</p>
          <p>
            Holberton School offers flexible tuition options that allow you to
            focus on school, not tuition. To top it all off, some of our
            campuses offer living stipends and scholarships to help you cover
            the cost of living while you attend school full-time.

        <h2>Who is Holberton?</h2>
        <p class="aside-subtitle">OUR NAME</p>
        <p>
          Frances Elizabeth "Betty" Snyder Holberton (1917-2001) was one of the
          six programmers of the ENIAC, which was the first programmable,
          general-purpose electronic digital computer, created in 1943 by the US
          Army.
        </p>
        <p>
          Betty Holberton helped create what would later become modern-day
          software engineering and was also involved with creating and designing
          the FORTRAN and COBOL programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The daughters of Betty Snyder Holberton, Priscilla Holberton, and
          Pamela Holberton are happy that Betty Holberton is being recognized
          for her contributions and inspiring a new generation of women and men
          in technology.
        </p>
        <h2>The big mission behind education</h2>
        <p class="aside-subtitle">OUR PURPOSE</p>
        <p>
          The technology sector is the fastest growing and evolving industry in
          history. Our mission at Holberton School is to empower motivated and
          talented people, regardless of background, age, experience, or
          financial capacity, to succeed in their dream careers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also believe that diversity and inclusion are paramount to
          innovation. More viewpoints, life experiences, cultures, and voices
          mean more community-driven ideation and problem-solving. We are
          convinced that tech can only make solutions for the entire world when
          all viewpoints can be included at the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that tuition should not be a financial barrier to anyone
          wanting access to quality education. We are ready to invest in you by
          offering flexible tuitions options, allowing students to focus on
          school now, not tuition.

            Holberton School Launches in Azerbaijan!
          </h2>
          <h3 class="article-subtitle">
            A new door opens between Eastern Europe and West Asia for our
            Network of schools
          </h3>
          <p>
            We are very excited to announce that Azerbaijan is partnering with
            Holberton School to develop their human capital in the field of
            Information and Communication Technology (ICT). In Azerbaijan, the
            program is powered by Pasha Holding and the Innovation and Digital
            Development Agency (IDDA), that has undertaken a series of
            initiatives to increase the number of skilled professionals in tech.
            Hosting a Holberton School in Azerbaijan stands as a significant
            step towards the implementation of a digital landscape in the
            country.
          </p>
          <p>
            The arrival of Holberton School is fully supported by the Ministry
            of Digital Development and Transport, Rashad Nabiyev.
            <strong
              >“The development of human capital in the field of ICT is one of
              our priorities. We met with delegations from Harbor.Space
              University and Holberton School. They are famous for their
              innovative approaches to education around the world. We discussed
              common goals for training professional personnel in our country in
              the field of ICT and explored partnership opportunities,”
            </strong>
            the minister said.
